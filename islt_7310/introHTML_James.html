     Hello! My name is Mindy James, and I live in St. Louis with my husband and two sons who are entering tenth and seventh grades. I teach English Language Arts through our Special Education Department for grades 6-8. I have neither web application nor development experience; I have only used Word Press, Wix, and Google Sites which do not require knowledge of HTML or CSS. During this course, I expect to learn enough HTML and CSS to build my own website of writing and language resources that my students can use across all three grade levels. In my free time, I write IEPs, update goals, grade papers, do homework â€” you get the picture. On summer break, I like to camp, swim, bike, hike, canoe, visit farmers markets, and barbeque with friends and family. In downtime, I enjoy reading, sewing, crafting, doing small home improvement projects, and watching super campy tv.
